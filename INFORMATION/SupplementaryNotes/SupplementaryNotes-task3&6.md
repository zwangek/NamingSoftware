Task 6 Generate compatibility score based on 2 parameters. The first one is the difference in popularity between the user and the soulmate. To be specific, the algorithm find out the average rank of their names over the period between the user and the soulmate's year of birth. The reason why I choose this period is that this is a common period that is fair for both the user and the soulmate. The second parameter is the age difference, this parameter also take into consideration of the user's preference. A score is then generated based on these two parameters.

Task 3 use a object of Task3 class to handle the task of generating table&charts and generating a summary. The reason I choose object over static methods is that there are some common information shared between these two tasks, that is, the arraylist. By instantiating an object, we can generate this information only once in the constructor, then, all the methods of the object could have access to this information.
